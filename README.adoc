= Variscite BSP Platform

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed and use it as:

Install the `repo` utility:

[source,console]
$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

Download the BSP source:

[source,console]
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin
$: mkdir ~/var-fslc-yocto
$: cd ~/var-fslc-yocto
$: repo init -u https://github.com/varigit/variscite-bsp-platform -b hardknott -m <hardknott-5.4.xml|hardknott-5.10.xml>
$: repo sync -j4

At the end of the commands you have every metadata you need to start work with.

To start a simple image build:

5.4:
[source,console]
$: MACHINE=<machine> DISTRO=<distro> source ./setup-environment <build directory>
$: bitbake core-image-base

5.10:
[source,console]
$: MACHINE=<machine> DISTRO=<distro> source ./var-setup-release.sh <build directory>
$: bitbake core-image-base

You can use any directory to host your build.

The source code is checked out at `var-fslc-yocto/sources`.
